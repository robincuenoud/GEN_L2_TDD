### Comments

Since we build one commit only per chapiter, we didn't put the page number on each one, but we put the Chapiter's name. So you can seek page 5 for the table of contents with the mapping of chapiters and pages.


To focus on the essential modifications and not overcomplicate it visually, our UMLclasses have minimal association between them. However, the UML_Final.png should have everything linked.
